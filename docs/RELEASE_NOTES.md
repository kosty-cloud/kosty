# üöÄ Kosty Release Notes

## Version 1.3.1 - Organization Pagination Fix (2025-10-29)

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix
- **Organization Account Pagination**: Fixed issue where only the first 20 accounts were scanned in large organizations
  - Replaced direct `list_accounts()` call with `get_paginator('list_accounts')`
  - Now properly retrieves all accounts regardless of organization size
  - Maintains filtering of suspended accounts (`Status == 'ACTIVE'`)
  - Ensures complete coverage for organizations with 20+ accounts

### üè¢ Impact
- Organizations with more than 20 accounts now get full audit coverage
- No performance impact for smaller organizations
- Maintains existing async execution and error handling

## Version 1.3.0 - Cross-Account Role Configuration & Enhanced Error Handling (2025-10-29)

### üîê New Cross-Account Features
- **Configurable Cross-Account Roles**: Added `--cross-account-role` parameter to specify custom role names

  - Addresses environments with different role naming conventions

- **Separate Organizational Admin Account**: Added `--org-admin-account-id` parameter
  - Supports scenarios where the current account lacks Organizations API access
  - Example: `kosty audit --organization --org-admin-account-id 123456789012`
  - Kosty first assumes a role in the specified admin account before listing organization accounts
